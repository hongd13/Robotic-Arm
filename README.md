# Automated Object Handling with UR5e 6-DoF Robotic Arm

*This document contains a demonstration of controlling the robotic arm in a simulated environment using a hybrid behaviour model.*

*Note: Credit for the Webots environment setup and kinematics transformation goes to Aston University.*

## Introduction

The demonstration involves tasking the robotic arm picking up 5 cubes on a flat table top surface, and then dropping them into a basket on the same table top.
